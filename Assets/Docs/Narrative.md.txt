# Verdant Remains â€” Narrative System

## Hybrid Presentation
- **Show**: environment reacts (scars, smoke, props).
- **Tell**: procedural event feed provides context.
- Synchronization via `GameEvent` struct.

## Event Feed
- Persistent UI feed with categories (combat, social, environment).
- Color-coded.
- Pop-up expansion for extended lore.
- Procedural text tokens for variety.

## Anchors
- Crew selection (pre-crash).
- Crash site tutorial (soft onboarding).
- First wall built.
- First raid survived.

## Tone
- Minimal exposition.
- Consequences shown quietly over time.
- The world feels indifferent.

## Current Status
- Hybrid model defined.
- Event system partially stubbed (NarrativeEvents.cs).
