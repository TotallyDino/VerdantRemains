# Verdant Remains — Builder System

## Overview
- Grid-based placement system.
- Blueprint → Frame → Finished construction flow.
- Validators: bounds, occupancy, cost.
- Auto-linking for NESW adjacency (walls/floors).
- Supports dismantle & salvage.
- Fully data-driven through `BuildableDataStore` + prefabs.

## Roadmap Phases
- Phase 1–4: Minimal BuildPlacer, validators, Frame/Finished flow, dismantle.
- Phase 5–7: Auto-linking, blueprint mode, resource integration.
- Phase 8–9: Multi-cell & multi-layer structures.
- Phase 10–11: Environmental effects & AI builder integration.
- Phase 12–14: Expanded library, narrative hooks, polish & save/load.

## Current Status
- ✅ Phase 0 prerequisites: ghost materials, prefabs, buildable/resource data stores.
- Next: Phase 1 BuildPlacer implementation.
