# Verdant Remains — AI Systems

## Builder AI
- Colonists complete BuildTasks.
- Haul resources to site.
- Work until structure finishes.

## Needs AI
- Hunger, thirst, fatigue influence priorities.
- Rest → eat → work cycles.

## Combat AI
- Simple raids with hostile entities.
- Player can control leader.
- Squad AI: follow, move, fight.

## Technical Approach
- Unity Behavior Designer or custom behavior trees.
- Task system feeds into AI planner.
- EventBus used for task assignment.

## Current Status
- Concept only; no AI tasks implemented yet.
- Planned after Phase 3–4 Build loop is stable.
