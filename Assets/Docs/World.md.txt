# Verdant Remains — World & Biomes

## Procedural Terrain
- Deterministic seed-based generation.
- MVP: 512×512 maps, Plains + Forest biomes.
- Guaranteed crash site POI near center.
- Secondary POIs (wrecks, groves) distributed via blue-noise sampling.
- NavMesh baked for walkable mask.

## Biomes
- Plains: open fields, balanced resources.
- Forest: denser vegetation, higher moisture.
- Expansion: Glass Desert, Mire, Mountains, etc.

## Hazards
- Plains: spore veil, roaming predators.
- Forest: echo mist, choking flora.
- Glass Desert: lightning → slag glass, glass breath storms.
- Mountains: frost, landslides.

## Environmental Systems
- Weather loops: rain, storms, fog, lightning.
- Day/night cycle.
- Environmental decay: buildables deteriorate under conditions.

## Current Status
- ✅ Procedural terrain pipeline defined.
- ❌ Not yet integrated into Unity (Phase W1 target).
