# Verdant Remains — Master Design Doc
_Last updated: Phase 0 complete_

---

## 1. High-Level Pitch
**Verdant Remains** is an isometric, systems-driven builder/survival game. Players harvest resources, build structures, and progress through narrative beats while managing scarcity and threats. Core loop: **Explore → Gather → Build → Upgrade → Survive**.

### Design Pillars
- **Tactile Building:** Snappy, grid-based placement with clear validation.
- **Meaningful Scarcity:** Resources (wood, steel, food, water) gate expansion.
- **Readable Isometric Visuals:** Ghosts, overlays, and heatmaps give feedback.
- **Composable Systems:** Data-driven via ScriptableObjects.
- **Hybrid Presentation:** “Show” via environment, “Tell” via event feed.

---

## 2. Roadmap Milestones
- ✅ Phase 0: Foundations (grid, input, debug, perf baseline)
- Milestone 1: Prototype (Build loop + colonist core + world seed)
- Milestone 2: Survival Loop
- Milestone 3: Expansion
- Milestone 4: World Alive
- Milestone 5: Content & Polish

---

## 3. Current Status
- Phase 0 complete (all checklist items met)
- Perf baseline validated (300 props at ~80–90 fps)
- Supporting docs split into `Builder.md`, `World.md`, `Colony.md`, `Narrative.md`, `AI.md`, `StyleGuide.md`
